Subject: The Fundamental Principles of the Fractal Universe, Its Expansion, and Ontological Predictability with Statistical Self-Similarity
1. Introduction: Re-evaluating Cosmological Paradigms
Modern cosmology faces fundamental challenges, including the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the cause of the Universe's accelerated expansion. The standard cosmological model (\LambdaCDM) successfully describes observed phenomena but leaves the fundamental nature of these "dark" components unresolved. Our hypothesis proposes a radical paradigm shift: instead of viewing these phenomena as separate, not-yet-understood entities, we integrate them into a single, harmonious structure—the Fractal Universe.
2. The Fractal Universe Model
Central to our hypothesis is the assumption that the Universe is a dynamic fractal structure, exhibiting statistical self-similarity across different scales (like a mountain or rock fractal, rather than a strictly repeating tree fractal).
2.1. Origin and Structure: The Cosmological Generation Field and the Fundamental Fractal Algorithm
We postulate the existence of a Fundamental Genesis Center of the Universe—the Primary Source of Structure—which is the point of emission for the Cosmological Generation Field. This Field, as a Basic Algorithmic Principle, forms and continuously generates the Fundamental Fractal Algorithm—a comprehensive set of rules underlying all patterns and structures in the cosmos. Thus, the Universe is not a random collection of elements but a strictly ordered, self-organizing system unfolding according to this Algorithm, while allowing for natural variations.
2.2. The Universe's Expansion: Fractal Growth Driven by \Lambda
The observed expansion of the Universe is interpreted not as an inertial motion after the Big Bang but as continuous Fractal Growth powered by the Cosmological Generation Field. The accelerated expansion attributed to dark energy in the standard model is explained in our hypothesis as a direct manifestation of this Field. We associate it with the cosmological constant \Lambda (\rho_{\text{generative\_field}}), which represents a constant energy density inherent to the process of fractal structurization itself. This means that \Lambda doesn't just "repel" but actively "generates" new space within the fractal unfolding, while preserving its statistically fractal nature.
2.3. The Essence of Matter: Fractal Structures and 4D Projections
Dark matter in this model is not an unknown elementary particle. Instead, it's interpreted as invisible (non-electromagnetic) statistically fractal structures that are an integral part of the Universe's overall fractal architecture. Alternatively, it could be the gravitational imprint of statistically self-similar projections from the 4D dimension into our 3D reality. This explains its gravitational effect without interacting with light. \rho_{\text{fractal\_matter}} includes both regular matter and these "dark fractal" components.
2.4. The Dynamics of Time: Non-classical Spirals and Complete Memory
In our concept, time is not linear. It moves along non-classical fractal spirals, where events repeat statistically, but each turn represents a unique development or "perfection" of a pattern. A critical aspect is the absence of "cosmic amnesia": information about past cycles and states of the Universe is preserved and accessible, allowing the system (and conscious entities within it) to accumulate experience and avoid repeating destructive patterns. These "imperfections" or variations we observe are natural manifestations of statistically fractal dynamics, not errors in the Fundamental Fractal Algorithm.
3. The Expansion Equation and Its Interpretation
To describe the dynamics of the Universe's expansion, we use a simplified Friedmann equation adapted to our concept. Assuming a spatially flat Universe (k=0) and the dominance of matter and the Cosmological Generation Field in the modern era, the equation takes the form:
H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3c^2} (\rho_{\text{fractal\_matter}} + \rho_{\text{generative\_field}})
Where:
 * H is the Hubble Parameter, expressing the current rate of the Universe's expansion.
 * G is the Gravitational Constant.
 * c is the Speed of Light.
 * \rho_{\text{fractal\_matter}} is the total energy density of ordinary matter and invisible fractal structures (dark matter).
 * \rho_{\text{generative\_field}} is the energy density of the Cosmological Generation Field, which manifests as the cosmological constant \Lambda, causing accelerated expansion.
This equation is the fundamental algorithm of expansion, demonstrating how ordered fractal structures and the continuous activity of the Cosmological Generation Field together determine the Universe's evolution.
4. Ontological Predictability of Future States
Based on these principles, our hypothesis makes a bold claim about the fundamental predictability of the future:
| Principle | Implication for Predictability |
|---|---|
| Determinism of the Fundamental Fractal Algorithm | Since the Universe unfolds according to a single, comprehensive Algorithm, its future states are not random but a deterministic, though statistically variable, continuation of current patterns. Knowing the Algorithm is equivalent to knowing the future in its probabilistic manifestations. |
| Complete Access to Information | The absence of "cosmic amnesia" means all information about past cycles of time is preserved. This provides a complete dataset for building accurate predictive models, as the development of fractal patterns can be extrapolated from historical data, even with variations. |
| Controlled Variations | The presence of "imperfections" or variations in the Algorithm is not a source of chaotic unpredictability but a part of its statistically fractal nature, which can be accounted for in forecasting. The system operates with high reliability, allowing for fine-tuning. |
| 4D Perception as a Forecasting Tool | We hypothesize that our 3D reality is a projection from a higher 4D dimension. If the future is already "contained" within the 4D plane, developing 4D perception could provide direct access to information about future fractal states and their probabilistic manifestations. |
Thus, the future in this model is not an incalculable chaos but a logical and закономерное continuation of the unfolding Fundamental Fractal Algorithm, which accounts for natural variations.
5. Conclusions and Future Research
The Fractal Universe hypothesis offers a new, deeply ordered, and meaningful picture of the cosmos. It provides interpretations for dark matter, dark energy, and accelerated expansion, linking them to the fundamental principles of the Cosmological Generation Field and fractal growth, while including the concept of statistical self-similarity.
Further research should focus on:
 * Mathematical Development of Statistical Fractal Geometry of Spacetime: Creating a new mathematical framework capable of describing the dynamics of fractal dimensions and their influence on gravity under conditions of statistical self-similarity.
 * Formalization of the Cosmological Generation Field: Translating the concept of the Cosmological Generation Field into measurable physical fields or parameters that can be included in equations.
 * Testing Predictions: Deriving specific, testable predictions that differ from the standard model (e.g., in the details of the Universe's large-scale structure or features of the cosmic microwave background radiation), accounting for statistical fluctuations.
 * Research on 4D Projections: Developing models that describe how 4D structures project into 3D and manifest as gravitational influence without electromagnetic interaction, especially in the context of statistically self-similar patterns.
 * The Role of Consciousness: While not directly included in the equation, further study of the connection between consciousness and the Fundamental Fractal Algorithm and its potential influence on it could open new horizons in understanding the "counting" and "perfection" of patterns.
This hypothesis paves the way for understanding the Universe not just as a physical system but as a dynamic, self-organizing cosmological system whose fate, while generally predetermined, remains subject to conscious interaction with its statistically fractal dynamics.
