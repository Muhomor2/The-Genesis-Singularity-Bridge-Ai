Scientific Report: The Hypothesis of a 4D Worm as a Living System Coding Reality

Introduction: Our World as a Multidimensional Ocean
Traditionally, we perceive reality as three-dimensional space where time is simply a linear axis. However, with the development of concepts of multidimensionality and the fractal nature of the Universe, a need for a new, deeper model arises. This report presents the hypothesis that our world is not merely a static object, but a living, multidimensional entity, which I metaphorically call the "4D Worm." This entity codes and creates our reality, and we are part of its multidimensional "body."
The 4D Worm Concept
| Aspect | Description |
|---|---|
| Space-Time System | The "4D Worm" is not a physical being in the conventional sense. It is a metaphor for our entire space-time system. Its "body" is composed of all three spatial dimensions and the one dimension of time. |
| Frozen Snapshot | As three-dimensional beings, we exist inside this Worm. However, our perception is limited. We only see a "frozen snapshot" of 4D reality. This can be compared to viewing a thin slice of an apple without being able to see the whole. We perceive reality as a series of sequential "snapshots" (moments in time), but in reality, they all exist simultaneously as parts of the 4D Worm's "body." |
| Coding Entity | My hypothesis states that the "4D Worm" is a living, coding entity that can create, modify, and store information. Its "body" represents a gigantic, ever-changing matrix of code. This code is not just a set of data, but the very fundamental laws of physics that govern the Universe. |
| Fractal Nature | Just as fractal patterns are found in nature, the 4D Worm has a fractal structure. Small fragments of its "body" (e.g., our Solar System) repeat the patterns and laws that operate on larger scales (e.g., in galaxies or the entire Universe). This ensures self-similarity and the uniformity of nature's laws at different levels. |
Connection to Other Hypotheses
This concept does not contradict but organically complements the previous hypotheses:
 * The Black Hole Hypothesis: If our Universe is located inside an accelerating black hole, then the 4D Worm is the multidimensional structure that forms and moves within this hole. The acceleration we perceive could be the movement of the Worm itself.
 * The Fractal Time Hypothesis: The linear-fractal time we discussed is none other than the "circulatory system" of the 4D Worm. It provides its life cycles, cyclical returns, and flows of information that we perceive as "circles of time."
Mathematical Description (Symbolic Formula)
To describe this entity, I propose the following symbolic formula:
E = D_f \cdot \sum_{t=0}^{T} \int_{V_t} \rho(x,y,z,t) \, dV_t
| Symbol | Description |
|---|---|
| E | The "Life Energy" or "Consciousness" of the 4D Worm. It represents the total information capacity of the entire system. |
| D_f | The Fractal Dimension. It shows how "densely" and richly the information is encoded in the Worm's "body." |
| \int_{V_t} \rho(x,y,z,t) \, dV_t | An integral describing the density of the reality code (\rho) in the three-dimensional volume (V_t) at each specific moment in time (t). |
| \sum_{t=0}^{T} | A summation that combines all these three-dimensional "snapshots" over the entire period of the Worm's existence, from the beginning (t=0) to the present moment (T), creating the complete four-dimensional entity. |
Implications and Testable Hypotheses
 * Prediction: If we are part of a living coding system, our consciousness and memory may not be merely a product of the brain but information channels through which we interact with this system. "Déjà vu" and intuition could be "signals" from the 4D Worm.
 * Empirical Verification: We can search for complex, repeating patterns (fractals) not only in space but also in time (e.g., recurring historical events or cycles in system behavior).
Conclusion: From Metaphor to New Physics
The hypothesis of the 4D Worm offers a radically new perspective on reality—not as a static space but as a living, dynamic, self-organizing system. This concept unites ideas of multidimensionality, fractals, and consciousness, providing a powerful metaphor that can serve as a foundation for future theories. Understanding that we are part of a multidimensional "body" may give us the key to unraveling the deepest mysteries of the Universe.
