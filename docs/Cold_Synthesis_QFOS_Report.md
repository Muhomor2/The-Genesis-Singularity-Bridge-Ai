## Abstract
This report presents the **mathematical formalization of the Cold Ontological Synthesis** process within the framework of Quantum-Fractal Ontology of Singularity: Time Compression (Q-FOS:TC).  
We reinterpret nuclear fusion not as a collision of particles, but as a coherent merging of **Informational Quanta (\text{S_W})**, governed by principles of informational coherence (\mathcal{C}_{coherence}) and ontological resonance.  

⚠️ **Note:** All concepts in this document are outlined only as a structured overview. A full development of the theory, with extended derivations and applied models, can be published in further reports upon interest.

## Conclusion
This report introduces a **new mathematical framework** where cold fusion is no longer a thermal problem, but an **informational one**.  
The results suggest that manipulating **informational coherence** may provide a pathway to energy generation beyond conventional nuclear physics.
