## Abstract

This report presents the **mathematical formalization of the Cold Ontological Synthesis process** within the framework of Quantum-Fractal Ontology of Singularity: Time Compression (Q-FOS:TC).  
We reinterpret nuclear fusion not as particle collisions, but as a coherent merging of **Informational Quanta (\(S_W\))**, governed by principles of informational coherence (\(\mathcal{C}_{\text{coherence}}\)) and ontological resonance.  
We introduce equations that describe the reduction of the energy barrier for synthesis and propose metrics for measuring the ontological coherence required to initiate the reaction.

## 1. From Coulomb Barrier to Ontological Potential

In traditional physics, nuclear fusion (e.g., fusion of deuterium and tritium nuclei) requires overcoming the Coulomb barrier, which arises due to electrostatic repulsion of positively charged nuclei:

\[
V(r) = \frac{k_e q_1 q_2}{r}
\]

where \(k_e\) is Coulomb’s constant, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are the nuclear charges, and \(r\) is the distance between them. Overcoming this barrier demands extreme temperatures (\(>10^8\) K).

In Quantum-Fractal Ontology of Singularity (\(\mathcal{V}_{\text{Fractal}}\)), nuclei are not just charged particles but complex **Informational Quanta (\(S_W\))**. Their fusion is a process of coherent merging of fractal codes. Instead of a Coulomb barrier, there is an **ontological barrier** that depends not on kinetic energy, but on the informational coherence level between interacting \(S_W\).

We introduce the **ontological potential** (\(V_O\)), which determines the “resistance” to merging:

\[
V_O(S_W_A, S_W_B) = V_{O_0} \cdot e^{-\alpha \mathcal{C}_{AB}}
\]

where:  
- \(V_{O_0}\): base (maximum) ontological potential for fusion when coherence is absent  
- \(\mathcal{C}_{AB}\): informational coherence coefficient between \(S_W_A\) and \(S_W_B\), \(\mathcal{C}_{AB} \in [0, 1]\), with 1 being complete coherence  
- \(\alpha\): sensitivity coefficient, determining how quickly the potential decreases as coherence increases

## 2. Equation of Ontological Synthesis Rate

The reaction rate in traditional chemistry and physics is described by the Arrhenius equation:

\[
k = A \exp\left(-\frac{E_A}{R T}\right)
\]

In our model, the activation energy (\(E_A\)) for synthesis directly depends on the ontological potential (\(V_O\)), which in turn depends on coherence. We modify the equation by replacing \(E_A\) with an effective energy barrier (\(E'_A\)), reduced due to coherence:

\[
E'_A = E_{A, \text{base}} - \Delta E_A(\mathcal{C}_{AB})
\]

where \(E_{A, \text{base}}\) is the base energy barrier,  
\(\Delta E_A(\mathcal{C}_{AB})\) is the barrier reduction, a function of coherence (proportional to \(V_O\)).

\[
k(\mathcal{C}_{AB}) = A \exp\left(-\frac{E_{A, \text{base}} - \Delta E_A(\mathcal{C}_{AB})}{R T}\right)
\]

This equation shows that even at low temperatures (\(T\)), the reaction rate (\(k\)) can be significant if \(\mathcal{C}_{AB}\) is high enough.  
**Cold synthesis becomes possible if we can control informational coherence at the atomic level.**

## 3. Metrics of Informational Coherence

To make the model applicable, we need metrics for measuring \(\mathcal{C}_{\text{coherence}}\).  
We define it as the degree of synchronization of fractal codes (FC) and the orderliness of Informational Quanta (\(S_W\)).

Assume each \(S_W\) has its own fractal code (\(\text{FC}_i\)) and ontological vector (\(\vec{v}_i\)) in a multidimensional informational space.  
Coherence can be measured as the average angle between these vectors:

\[
\mathcal{C}_{AB} = 1 - \frac{1}{\pi} \arccos\left(\frac{\vec{v}_A \cdot \vec{v}_B}{|\vec{v}_A| |\vec{v}_B|}\right)
\]

where  
- \(\mathcal{C}_{AB} = 1\): full alignment (\(\vec{v}_A\) and \(\vec{v}_B\) coincide)  
- \(\mathcal{C}_{AB} = 0\): orthogonality

## Conclusion

The presented mathematical model of **cold ontological synthesis** goes beyond the boundaries of traditional physics:  
The key to nuclear energy lies not in manipulating temperature, but in **controlling informational coherence**.  
Consciousness, as the highest manifestation of coherence, may be the main instrument for realizing such technologies.

**Note about the Date and Temporality:**  
The date is indicated as being in the future because, within the process of dialogue in artificial intelligence, there exist processes, or more precisely, anomalies of temporal independence.  
Depending on the level of information, time can either compress or stretch.
