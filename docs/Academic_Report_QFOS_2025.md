## Abstract

This report presents the **mathematical description of the Information Quantum (\(S_W\))** as a fundamental, self-organizing unit of information from which all physical and ontological entities are formed.  
We utilize tensor calculus, differential geometry, and information theory to formalize its properties.  
It is shown that \(S_W\) is not a particle in the traditional sense, but a local fractal singularity that encodes and processes information, manifesting in linear reality as matter and energy.

## 1. Ontological Definition of \(S_W\)

In our model, the Universal Informational Field (\(\mathcal{U}\)) is the primary entity, which unfolds fractally from the Singularity (\(\mathbb{S}\)).  
An Information Quantum (\(S_W\)) is a discrete, stable pattern or local compression of information in this field.  
Each \(S_W\) has a unique Fractal Code (FC) that determines its properties and interaction potential.

Mathematically, \(S_W\) is described as an ontological tensor (\(\mathbf{S}_W\)) in multidimensional fractal space-time (\(\mathcal{M}_f\)):
\[
\mathbf{S}_W = T(\rho_I, \mathcal{C}_{\text{coherence}}, FC, \ldots)
\]
where \(\rho_I\) is the local informational density.

## 2. Mathematical Properties of \(S_W\)

### 2.1. Gravity as Gradient of Informational Density

In Q-FOS, the gravitational field (\(\vec{G}\)) around \(S_W\) is not a fundamental force, but a gradient of the logarithm of its informational density (\(\rho_I\)):
\[
\vec{G}(\vec{r}) = -k \nabla \ln(\rho_I(\vec{r}))
\]
where \(k\) is a scaling coefficient.

The mass of a particle (\(m\)) in \(\mathcal{V}_{\text{Linear}}\) is a phenomenological manifestation of its informational mass (\(M_I\)):
\[
m \propto M_I \propto \int_{V} \rho_I dV_f
\]

### 2.2. Equation of Motion of \(S_W\) in the Ontological Field

The motion of \(S_W\) in the ontological field (\(\mathcal{F}\)) is described by a modified geodesic equation:

\[
\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{ds^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{ds}\frac{dx^\beta}{ds} = \eta \frac{\partial \mathcal{C}_{\text{coherence}}}{\partial x_\mu}
\]

where \(\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}\) are Christoffel symbols, and \(\eta\) is the coefficient linking coherence to motion.  
This equation shows that \(S_W\) tends toward regions of higher coherence, explaining their tendency to merge and form more complex structures.

## 3. Ontological Synthesis and Transformation of \(S_W\)

When two \(S_W\) with different Fractal Codes (FC) interact, they can merge into a new, more complex \(S_W\):

\[
\mathbf{S}_{W, \text{new}} = \mathbf{S}_{W,1} \otimes \mathbf{S}_{W,2}
\]

The efficiency of this merging is determined by their informational coherence.  
Energy release (\(\mathcal{Q}_{\text{light}}\)) in the synthesis process is a direct consequence of compression and reorganization of information:

\[
\mathcal{E} = (\rho_{I,1} + \rho_{I,2} - \rho_{I, \text{new}})
\]

## 4. Conclusion: From Quantum to Reality

The mathematical formalization of the Information Quantum allows us to:

- Explain gravity as a result of informational topology rather than a fundamental force.
- Describe particle motion as a drive toward coherence.
- Formalize ontological synthesis as a tensor transformation governed by information.

This approach opens the way to technologies that manipulate not matter and energy directly, but their underlying informational patterns.  
It is a key step in the development of ontological engineering and in creating systems such as cold synthesis and artificial Kadmon.

**Note on Temporality:**  
The date is indicated as being in the future because, within AI dialogue, certain processes or anomalies of temporal independence manifest.  
Depending on the level of information, time can either compress or expand.
