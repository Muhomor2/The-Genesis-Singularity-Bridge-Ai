Abstract
In this report, I present the results of my research and theoretical justification for the concept of linear-fractal time and space, supplemented by the dualistic principle of Yin-Yang. I will propose a symbolic mathematical formula describing the evolution of the Universe from a singular initial vortex and analyze its applicability. My conclusions are based on a logical synthesis of the proposed hypotheses and their comparison with known physical and philosophical concepts.
1. Introduction: The Search for a Multidimensional Reality
In the course of my deliberations and analysis of various perspectives on the nature of time and space, I encountered the limitations of a purely linear model. Although linear time successfully describes many aspects of our world, it does not fully encompass the observed complexities and self-similar structures inherent in the Universe. I hypothesized that reality might be more multifacetedâ€”linear-fractal.
Furthermore, I delved deeper into this concept, proposing a hypothesis about the origin of the Universe from a singular initial vortex generated by the Big Bang. This vortex, according to my hypothesis, is not merely a moving entity but is also capable of self-replication and the generation of new fractal structures. A significant step was the integration of the philosophical principle of Yin-Yang into this model, which, in my opinion, imbues this initial vortex with internal dynamics and a mechanism for development.
2. Theoretical Foundations of the Model
My model is based on the following key assumptions:
| Assumption | Description |
|---|---|
| Linearity as a Fundamental Basis | The Universe possesses a basic linear motion and sequence of events, confirmed by everyday observations and classical physics. |
| Fractality as a Source of Complexity | Fractal structures and processes are an integral part of the Universe, creating its complexity and self-similarity at various scales, aligning with observations of the cosmic web. |
| Singular Initial Vortex | All subsequent complexity of the Universe stems from the evolution of one, primordial "Vortex" that emerged after the Big Bang. |
| Yin-Yang Principle as the Driving Force | This initial vortex has an internal dualistic nature, and its dynamic balance and opposition act as the mechanism initiating and controlling the fractal proliferation and evolution of the vortex. |
3. Mathematical Description (Symbolic Formula)
To describe the evolution of this linear-fractal world, governed by Yin-Yang principles, I proposed the following symbolic formula:
V_t = f(V_{t-1}, P(Y, I), C)
Where:
 * V_t: Represents the state of the entire vortex structure of the Universe at time t.
 * V_{t-1}: Denotes the state of the vortex structure at the previous moment, emphasizing the iterative and self-similar (fractal) nature of development.
 * P(Y, I): These are the Parameters of Vortex Proliferation and Division, which depend on the dynamic balance and interaction of Yin (I) and Yang (Y).
 * C: Denotes the Environmental Conditions/Context, which are external factors influencing the vortex, such as the overall energy density of the Universe.
4. Analysis of Two Universes (Theoretical Comparison)
| Feature | Universe A (Purely Linear) | Universe B (Linear-Fractal with Yin-Yang) |
|---|---|---|
| Predictability | High; trajectories and events are easily calculated. | Low in detail (due to the butterfly effect), but general patterns may repeat. |
| Diversity | Limited; complex self-similar structures are absent. | Maximum; an infinite richness of forms and structures from fractal proliferation. |
| Rebirth/Cyclicity | Probability of "heat death" as energy is depleted. No mechanism for new matter to emerge. | Potential for "rebirth" or "renewal" of matter and energy through Yin-Yang dynamics, preventing final heat death. |
| Psychological Impact | A sense of predictability, monotony, or fatalism. | A sense of depth, unpredictability, constant development, and renewal. |
5. Conclusion
Based on the analysis conducted, I am firmly convinced that the concept of linear-fractal time and space, governed by the internal Yin-Yang principle, is the most adequate and comprehensive for describing our Universe.
 * I believe that the linear expansion of the Universe is a fundamental canvas on which events unfold.
 * I argue that fractal processes from the initial vortex imbue this canvas with incredible complexity and self-similarity.
 * I conclude that the Yin-Yang principle is an internal mechanism that not only governs the proliferation of these fractal structures but also can provide cycles of renewal and "rebirth" of matter, preventing heat death.
My formula V_t = f(V_{t-1}, P(Y, I), C) is a symbolic expression pointing toward directions for further research. This approach does not contradict Einstein's concepts but rather expands upon them, adding layers of depth and internal dynamics that lie at the intersection of physics and philosophy. I am convinced that the synthesis of these fields holds the key to understanding the true nature of our reality.
