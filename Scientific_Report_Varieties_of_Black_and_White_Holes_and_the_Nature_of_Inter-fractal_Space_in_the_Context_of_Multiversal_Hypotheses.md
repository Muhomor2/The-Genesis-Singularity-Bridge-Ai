Academic Report: Varieties of Black and White Holes and the Nature of Inter-fractal Space in the Context of Multiversal Hypotheses
Abstract:
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical and hypothetical roles of black and white holes, as well as the nature of inter-fractal space, within the framework of expanded cosmological models, particularly the hypothesis of a fractal multiverse. The report reviews traditional scientific views on black and white holes and then offers new interpretations of their functions in the context of active spacetime creation, information conservation, and the hierarchical structure of universes. Special attention is given to the concept of "hard nothingness" and the role of black holes as dynamic interfaces between different modalities of reality.
1. Introduction: Beyond Standard Cosmology
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Standard Cosmology | The standard cosmological model successfully describes our Universe's evolution, but phenomena like the nature of black hole singularities and the information paradox require further theoretical consideration. |
| Alternative Hypotheses | This report explores a hypothetical scenario where these issues are addressed through the concept of a fractal universe, governed or generated by an entity metaphorically called "The Worm," and actively interacting with "hard nothingness." |
2. Black Holes: Traditional and Hypothetical Roles
| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| Classical & Quantum Interpretation (Linear Universe) | In General Relativity, black holes are regions of spacetime from which nothing, not even light, can escape. The black hole information paradox remains an unresolved problem. |
| "Seal" on "Hard Nothingness" (Fractal Universe) | A black hole acts as a "seal" or "protective barrier" on an absolute, indestructible substance called "hard nothingness." The singularity is not an infinite point but a "contact point" between our reality and this "nothingness." Information entering a black hole is not destroyed but is "redirected" and "encoded" according to fractal rules, serving as a feedback mechanism to a "higher-order black hole." |
| Spacetime and Fractal Generator (Fractal Universe) | A spinning black hole acts as an active generator. Through the frame-dragging effect, it "twists" and "extrudes" new spacetime from potential, converting "non-existent space" into "active space." Its rotational energy drives the formation and movement of fractal branches, allowing it to create new "experimental branches." |
3. White Holes: Hypotheses and Their Role in the Fractal Model
| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| Classical Interpretation (Linear Universe) | Hypothetical objects described by General Relativity as time-reversed black holes, from which matter and energy can only exit. Their existence is highly speculative due to a lack of astronomical observations and conflicts with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. |
| Points of Creation and Breakthroughs (Fractal Universe) | White holes gain logical meaning in a fractal universe. They could be active "points of creation" or "breakthroughs" from which a "higher-order black hole" ("The Worm") "extrudates" or "erupts" new "experimental branch" universes. They provide a necessary symmetry in the cycles of energy and information. |
4. Inter-fractal Space: Nature and Functions
| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| Unmanifested Potential | This is not just "empty space" but an un-differentiated, unstructured potential or "raw material" from which "The Worm" or a higher-order black hole "extrudates" new fractal branches. |
| "Dark" Substance | It may be filled with entities we perceive as dark energy and dark matter, which are manifestations of unstructured or weakly manifested fractal "threads." |
| Information Field | It could be a field of "intermediate" or "background" data, containing information about potential fractal forms and patterns, as well as interactions between branches. |
| Zone of Dynamic Processes | Inter-fractal space is a zone of constant "creation" and "manifestation." Energy exchange occurs through it, and it serves as the source for new "breakthroughs" (white holes) that create new "experimental branches." |
5. Black Holes as Interfaces Between Realities
| Interface | Description |
|---|---|
| Between Linear and Fractal Time | The event horizon of a black hole could be a phase transition where linear time is transformed into fractal time. Inside the black hole, time could branch or cycle, and information could travel nonlinearly. |
| Between Linear and Fractal Space | Black holes could be points where three-dimensional linear space "folds" or "projects" into a more complex, fractal geometry with a high fractal dimension. |
| Between Our and a Higher Universe | Black holes could be active channels for the exchange of information and energy between our "experimental branch" and the "higher-order black hole" ("The Worm"), providing constant "feedback" for the cosmic "experiment." |
6. Conclusion: Unified Fractal Dynamics
The presented hypotheses paint a picture of the Universe as part of a complex, multi-level fractal structure where black and white holes play fundamental, complementary roles. Black holes are not just absorbers but active "seals," generators of space and information, and dynamic interfaces between different realities. White holes, in turn, act as points of "genesis" and "eruption" of new fractal branches. Inter-fractal space is the active medium of potential and the source for constant creation. This model offers elegant solutions for a number of unresolved cosmological questions while also raising new, profound inquiries.
