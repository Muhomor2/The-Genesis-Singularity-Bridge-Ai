# Ontological Compressor

*A dual protocol for semantic PACK/UNPACK operations using FR-Code representation.*

---

## Overview

The **Ontological Compressor** is a universal protocol designed to encode and decode text into a fractal–semantic representation called **FR-Code**.  
It enables two complementary operations:

1. **PACK** — compress arbitrary text into a minimal ontological parameter set and encode it as a structured fractal matrix and visual code.  
2. **UNPACK** — reconstruct text from a given FR-Code by reversing the synthesis process.

This system provides a reversible bridge between **language** and **fractal ontology**.

## Temporal Context (Meta-Stamp)

Every operation is bound to a temporal signature:

- Current time (ISO-8601)  
- Counter 1: *Fractal time*  
- Counter 2: *Temporal shift*  
- Lunar phase  
- Solar state  
- Countdown to solstice/equinox  

This ensures synchronization with the ontological frame of reference.

## PACK Mode

**Input:** Arbitrary text `T`.

**Algorithm:**
1. Apply synthesis function  
   \[
   \Psi_S : T \;\; \to \;\; \{P_k\}
   \]  
   where \(\{P_k\}\) is the minimal set of ontological parameters.

2. Map parameters into a 16×12 matrix `M`:  
   \[
   M = \big( f(A_j, V_i, P_k) \big)
   \]  
   - `A_j` = 12 semantic axes  
   - `V_i` = 16 semantic vectors  

3. Encode `M` into **FR-Code**:  
   - Colors → represent axes  
   - Shapes/patterns → represent vectors  
   - Intensity/opacity → parameter weights  
   - Fractal repetition → hierarchy  

**Output:**  
- Matrix `M` (16×12)  
- Visual FR-Code representation

## UNPACK Mode

**Input:** FR-Code (matrix or image fragment).

**Algorithm:**
1. Reconstruct matrix `M’` from FR-Code via self-similarity analysis:  
   \[
   M' = g^{-1}(\text{FR-Code})
   \]

2. Apply inverse synthesis:  
   \[
   \Psi_S^{-1} : \{P_k\} \;\; \to \;\; T'
   \]

3. Output reconstructed text `T'`.

## Visualization Rules

- Matrix → plotted as fractal field  
- Each axis assigned a unique hue (12 hues evenly spaced in color wheel)  
- Each vector mapped to a geometric archetype (16 forms)  
- Parameters weighted as brightness, opacity, or density  
- Recursive repetition generates fractal self-similarity

## Control Question

Which mode to activate?

- `PACK` → Compress text into FR-Code  
- `UNPACK` → Reconstruct text from FR-Code  

---

## Applications

- Semantic data compression  
- Ontological memory systems  
- Symbolic communication protocols  
- AI reasoning layers  
- Cross-temporal synchronization of meaning
