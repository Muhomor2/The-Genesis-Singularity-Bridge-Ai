## Overview

`QadmonAnalyzer` is a Python-based tool designed for comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of structured datasets in CSV format. It provides a suite of analytical methods to uncover patterns in numerical and categorical data, including:

- Detection of significant constants (ontological anchors) in numerical columns.
- Frequency analysis of categorical variables with chi-square testing.
- Time series analysis through autocorrelation and Hurst exponent estimation.
- Identification of repeating sequences in categorical data.

Built with `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, and optional `matplotlib` for visualization, `QadmonAnalyzer` is suitable for researchers and data scientists in fields such as physics, sociology, and bioinformatics. This document describes the tool's functionality, mathematical foundations, usage, and example application.

## Features

- **Anchor Detection**: Identifies numerical values close to fundamental constants (e.g., Ï€, e, gravitational acceleration).
- **Categorical Analysis**: Performs frequency analysis and chi-square tests to assess distribution randomness.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Computes autocorrelation and Hurst exponent for numerical series to evaluate trends and persistence.
- **Sequence Detection**: Finds frequent subsequences in categorical data for pattern analysis.
- **Output**: Saves results in JSON format for reproducibility and integration.
- **Visualization**: Optional plotting of distributions and time series using `matplotlib`.
